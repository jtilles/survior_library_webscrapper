# Survivor Library Web Scrapper

This is a an example app for me to practice web scrapping.  I will first webscrape all the URLs from [The Survivor Library](http://www.survivorlibrary.com/) and then proceed to download them in a logical folder structure, matching that of the site.

# Use
1. Download the repo and make sure python is installed (python 3.8 was tested)
2. Install the requirements using the following command:
```
python pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the app using the command:
```
python ./app.py
```
